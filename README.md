# Utremi
This code is for performing ancestral niche reconstruction according to the histogram method discussed in Folk et al. 2022 (reference at the bottom of this page) and reproducing analyses from the same paper.

The quoted code should be run in bash. Ensure that paths of output from each step are not being messed with. Some paths are hard-coded in scripts and should be changed as noted. PNO files should be in a directory called "pnos", and the path to mcmc output should be updated in `date_histograms_from_mcmctree.r`.

## Setup  
If you want to run this pipeline yourself, clone the repository such that your directory setup is as follows:

```     
Directory/   
├── data # Replace with your own data
|	├── astral_mcmctree_rep3.tre (tree file - dated)
|	├── mcmc.txt    
|	└──...   
├── pnos # Replace with your own data
|	├──
|	└── ...   
├── results # These are previously calculated results
|	└── 
├── scripts # From repository
|	├──  dating_histograms.csv (from date_histograms_from_mcmctree.r)   
|	├──   annotate_maximum_density.py   
|	├──   trim_sum_and_normalize_projections.py   
|	├──   projections_binned_ancestralreconstruction.py   
|	├──   weight_projection_by_date_probability.py   
└─ 	└──   date_histograms_from_mcmctree.r   
├── comparision
|	├──  phyloclim
|	     ├──  01_phyloclim_run.R
|	     ├── data
|	         ├── PNO
|               └─── ... 
└─           └── astral_mcmctree_rep3.tre
```

To duplicate paper results, run as follows without changes. The only thing missing in the path is paleoclimatic data (see Dryad).

## Subfolders
### `data`
Tree and MCMCtree output.

### `occurrences`
Occurrence files in the expected format for [pno_calc](https://github.com/ryanafolk/pno_calc).

### `pnos`
PNO files in the expected format.

### `scripts`
Python and R scripts.

### `results`
`ancestral_reconstruction` folders contain paper results comprising trees with the ancestral reconstruction (in BEAST-style format) and plots of both extant and ancestral reconstruction histograms. There is a folder for each of the ASTRAL and concatenation topologies. Plots of histograms are blue for the ML result, and red and green representing +- standard error.

`ancestral_projection` folders contain results comprising an animated GIF showing trends in habitat suitability from the Pleistocene to present based on mean annual temperature. There is a folder for each of the ASTRAL and concatenation topologies.

### `comparison`  
Comparsion with previous published methods including phyloclim and ambitus. 

## Dependencies
The python scripts have various dependencies that can be queried by attempting to run the scripts; full installation instructions are only given for BiotaphyPy below. Most important is a full working install of GDAL (both the Python library and the executables) that is in the path. GDAL can be challenging to install on some systems; for Ubuntu systems `apt` is recommended and `homebrew` or `miniconda` for OS-X. The Python bindings must also be available; e.g., typing `gdal_translate` in the shell should execute. A further incomplete list is:
```
pip3 install rasterio
pip3 install dendropy
```

## Set up directory structure
```
mkdir ancestral_reconstruction_astral

mkdir ancestral_projection_astral
```

## Ancestral niche analyses
### 1. Install BiotaphyPy
```
cd ancestral_reconstruction_astral
git clone https://github.com/biotaphy/BiotaPhyPy
cd BiotaPhyPy/
python setup.py install
cd ..
```
Ensure the cloned repository remains in the working directory for the next step.

### 2. Run ancestral niche reconstruction in a loop, one iteration per variable
```
for f in ./../pnos/*.dropped; do
    g=$( echo ${f} | sed 's/.*\///g' | sed 's/\..*//g' )
    echo ${g}
    mkdir plots_${g}
    python3 BiotaPhyPy/biotaphy/tools/ancestral_distribution.py ./../data/astral_mcmctree_rep3.tre newick ${f} csv out_${g}.tre nexus -c out_table_${g}.txt -p plots_${g}
    done
```

### 3. Annotate trees by the single bin value with maximum probability density
This is used for color plotting. In the case of ties one is arbitrarily taken.
```
for f in out_*.tre; do
    g=`echo ${f} | sed 's/\.tre//g'`
    python3 ./../scripts/annotate_maximum_density.py ${f} ${g}.maxdensity.tre
    done
```


## Downstream analyses
### 1. Generate histograms representing dating uncertainty
Generates dating histograms from MCMCtree output. Note the path to the mcmc.txt file output by this package is hard-coded on line 2 and should be updated as appropriate.
```
cd ..
cd ancestral_projection_astral
R CMD BATCH ./../scripts/date_histograms_from_mcmctree.r 
# A file called dating_histograms.csv should appear in the working directory
```

### 2. Perform geographic range projections on paleoclimate data
```
python3 ./../scripts/projections_binned_ancestralreconstruction.py ./../ancestral_reconstruction_astral/out_table_BIOCLIM_1.txt ./BIOCLIM_1 -l /mnt/Botbot/heuchera_research/Heuchera_complete_project/ShellyFinal_NovemberLayers_2019/bio1_final/*.tif
mkdir projected
mv *tifout*.tif ./projected/
# There should now be lots of TIFs in a folder called projected
```

### 3. Weight projections by posterior probability of occurrence date
File paths should reflect output of #1 and #2 above and should not be messed with just yet.  
```
python3 ./../scripts/weight_projection_by_date_probability.py dating_histograms.csv 
# There should now be yet more TIFs in a folder called projected_weighted
```
   
### 4. Trim the projections to the study area, normalize histogram area, and combine across species.  
```
mkdir combined_normalized
for i in `ls projected_weighted/*.tif | sed 's/.*_//g' | sed 's/\.tif//g' | sort | uniq`; do
    python3 ./../scripts/trim_sum_and_normalize_projections.py ./combined_normalized/${i}.combined.tif -178.2 6.6 -49.0 83.3 --rasters `ls projected_weighted/*_${i}.*tif`
    done
```
We end up with one TIF per time period, representing joint probabilities of occurrence for all species.

All scripts contain usage examples in header comments.
